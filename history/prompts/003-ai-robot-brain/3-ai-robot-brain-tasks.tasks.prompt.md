## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

I've generated the complete task list for the AI-Robot Brain module (NVIDIA Isaac™) with:

1. Created tasks.md at specs/003-ai-robot-brain/tasks.md with 22 specific tasks organized by user story
2. Organized tasks in 6 phases: Setup, Foundational, and 3 user stories (P1-P3) plus Polish phase
3. Each task follows the required format: [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path
4. Tasks are organized by priority (P1, P2, P3) with User Story 1 as MVP
5. Included dependencies and parallel execution opportunities
6. Added implementation strategy for incremental delivery

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created comprehensive task list with 22 tasks organized by user story
- 🧪 Tests: No explicit test requirements in feature specification
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md with proper structure and organization
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation following the task list
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully organized tasks by user story for independent implementation

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed:
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL):
- Prompt variant (if applicable):
- Next experiment (smallest change to try):
