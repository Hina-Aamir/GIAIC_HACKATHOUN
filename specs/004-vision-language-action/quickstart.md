# Quickstart: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Module

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of ROS 2 fundamentals
- Basic knowledge of AI/ML concepts
- Familiarity with humanoid robotics concepts
- Access to VLA research papers and documentation

## Setup and Installation
1. Ensure Docusaurus is properly configured: `npm install -g @docusaurus/core`
2. Navigate to the project documentation directory
3. Verify the module structure is created as defined in the plan

## Module Structure
The module consists of three main chapters:
1. **Chapter 1**: Voice interfaces and speech processing for humanoid robots
2. **Chapter 2**: LLM-driven cognitive planning and ROS 2 integration
3. **Chapter 3**: Integrated VLA pipeline and autonomous capstone concepts

## Getting Started
- Begin with Chapter 1 to understand voice processing fundamentals
- Progress to Chapter 2 to learn about LLM integration and planning
- Complete with Chapter 3 for integrated VLA system concepts
- Each chapter includes practical examples and implementation guidance

## Key Concepts Overview
- Vision-Language-Action pipeline integration
- Natural language processing for robotics
- Real-time action planning and execution
- Safety considerations in autonomous systems
