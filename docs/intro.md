# Introduction

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. This AI/Spec-driven technical book covers the fundamental concepts, implementation details, and practical applications of physical AI and humanoid robotics.

## About This Book

This book is designed to provide comprehensive coverage of:

- ROS 2 as middleware for humanoid robot control
- Integration of AI agents with robotic systems
- Humanoid robot modeling and simulation
- Advanced control algorithms for bipedal locomotion
- Perception systems for humanoid robots
- AI decision-making in physical environments

## Target Audience

This book is intended for:
- Robotics engineers and researchers
- AI and machine learning practitioners
- Software engineers working on robotic systems
- Students studying robotics and AI
- Anyone interested in the intersection of AI and physical systems

## How to Use This Book

The book is organized into modules, each covering specific aspects of humanoid robotics:

- **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Covers ROS 2 fundamentals, AI agent integration with rclpy, and humanoid robot modeling with URDF
- **Module 2**: Simulation Environments (Coming Soon) - Will cover simulation frameworks and testing environments
- **Module 3**: AI Control Systems (Coming Soon) - Will cover advanced AI algorithms for robot control

Each module contains theoretical concepts, practical examples, and hands-on exercises to reinforce learning.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this book, you should have:
- Basic programming knowledge (Python preferred)
- Understanding of robotics concepts (helpful but not required)
- Familiarity with Linux command line (for ROS 2)

## Getting Started

Begin with Module 1 to understand the foundational concepts of ROS 2 and how AI agents integrate with robotic systems. Each module builds on the previous one, so we recommend following the sequence presented in the sidebar.
