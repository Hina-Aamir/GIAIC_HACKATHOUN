# Glossary: The AI-Robot Brain – NVIDIA Isaac™

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the NVIDIA Isaac module.

## A

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems, used in robotics for perception, decision-making, and control.

## C

**Computer Vision**: A field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world, using digital images, video, and deep learning models.

## H

**Hardware Acceleration**: The use of computer hardware specially made to perform specific tasks, often more efficiently than software running on a CPU.

## I

**Isaac ROS**: NVIDIA's collection of GPU-accelerated perception and navigation packages for robotics, built on the Robot Operating System (ROS).

**Isaac Sim**: NVIDIA's robotics simulator that provides ground-truth data and physically accurate synthetic data generation for AI training.

## N

**Navigation**: The process by which a robot determines and follows a path from its current location to a desired destination.

**Nav2**: The Navigation Toolbox 2.0, a modern, flexible, and extensible framework for robot path planning and navigation.

## P

**Perception**: The process by which robots interpret sensor data to understand their environment and make decisions.

## S

**Simulation**: The imitation of the operation of a real-world process or system over time, especially used for training AI models.

**SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: The computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within it.

## V

**VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: A technology that uses visual sensors to simultaneously localize a robot and create a map of its environment.

**Visual Odometry**: The process of determining the position and orientation of a robot by analyzing the associated camera images.

## Y

**YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)**: A human-readable data serialization language commonly used for configuration files in ROS and Isaac systems.
