# Nav2 and Humanoid Navigation Concepts

This chapter focuses on Nav2, the navigation stack for planning and executing robot movement paths in complex environments, with special attention to humanoid navigation concepts. You'll learn about path planning, execution, and the specialized considerations for bipedal robot movement.

## Chapter Overview

In this chapter, you will learn:
- The fundamentals of Nav2 navigation stack
- Path planning and execution concepts
- Specialized navigation for humanoid robots
- Integration with perception systems from previous chapters

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Explain how humanoid robots plan and execute navigation paths
- Describe the integration between perception and navigation systems
- Implement basic navigation behaviors using Nav2
- Understand the challenges of humanoid-specific navigation

## Integration with the Isaac Ecosystem

This chapter completes the perception-to-navigation pipeline and prepares you for more advanced AI-robotics integration concepts.

- **Connection to Chapter 1**: This chapter uses perception models trained with synthetic data from Isaac Sim (Chapter 1) to inform navigation decisions.
- **Connection to Chapter 2**: This chapter receives perception data from Isaac ROS (Chapter 2) to make informed navigation decisions.

To complete your understanding of the Isaac ecosystem, review the [Summary: Complete Pipeline Overview](../summary).
