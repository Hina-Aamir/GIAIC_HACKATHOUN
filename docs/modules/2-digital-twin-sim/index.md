# The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module focuses on physics-based simulation and environment modeling for digital twins of humanoid robots, covering Gazebo physics simulation, Unity visualization, and sensor simulation.

## Learning Path

This module is structured into three comprehensive chapters that form a complete digital twin simulation pipeline:

1. [Chapter 1: Physics Simulation in Gazebo](./chapter-1-gazebo-physics/) - Learn about physics-based simulation with gravity, collisions, and realistic physical behaviors
2. [Chapter 2: High-Fidelity Visualization in Unity](./chapter-2-unity-visualization/) - Explore advanced visualization techniques for digital twins
3. [Chapter 3: Sensor Simulation Implementation](./chapter-3-sensor-simulation/) - Implement realistic sensor simulation for LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- ROS 2 fundamentals
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with simulation environments

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:
- How to create and interact with physics-based simulations in Gazebo
- How to develop high-fidelity visualizations in Unity
- How to simulate various sensors for realistic perception system development
- The concept of digital twins for humanoid robots

## What You'll Learn

This module covers the complete simulation pipeline from basic physics to advanced visualization and sensor modeling, providing you with the knowledge needed to create realistic digital twins of humanoid robots.

## The Digital Twin Pipeline

The three chapters in this module form a cohesive pipeline that demonstrates how modern robotics simulation integrates physics, visualization, and sensing:

- **Chapter 1** establishes the foundation with Gazebo physics simulation, where you learn to create realistic physical behaviors with gravity, collisions, and material properties.

- **Chapter 2** builds on the physics foundation with Unity visualization, where you explore high-fidelity rendering techniques that make digital twins visually realistic and engaging.

- **Chapter 3** completes the digital twin with sensor simulation, where you implement realistic sensors that provide the perception data needed for autonomous robotics systems.

## Assessment

After completing all three chapters, you should be able to:
1. Create a complete digital twin simulation with realistic physics, visualization, and sensing
2. Understand how physics simulation provides the foundation for realistic behavior
3. Implement high-fidelity visualization that matches physical properties
4. Simulate sensors that provide realistic perception data for robotics algorithms
