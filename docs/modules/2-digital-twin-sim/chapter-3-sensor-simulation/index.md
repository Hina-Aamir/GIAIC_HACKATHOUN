# Sensor Simulation Implementation

This chapter focuses on simulating various sensors in both Gazebo and Unity environments for realistic perception system development. You'll learn to configure and implement LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs for humanoid robot digital twins.

## Chapter Overview

In this chapter, you will learn:
- How to simulate LiDAR sensors with realistic point cloud generation
- How to implement depth cameras with realistic perception
- How to configure IMU sensors with realistic data output
- Integration of sensor simulation with ROS 2

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Configure realistic sensor simulation for humanoid robots
- Understand and implement point cloud generation from LiDAR
- Generate realistic depth camera data and IMU measurements
- Analyze and validate simulated sensor data
