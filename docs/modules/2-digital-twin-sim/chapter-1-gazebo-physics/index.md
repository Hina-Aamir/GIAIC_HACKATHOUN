# Physics Simulation in Gazebo

This chapter introduces you to Gazebo, a physics-based simulation environment for robotics. You'll learn about creating and interacting with physics-based simulations for humanoid robots, understanding gravity, collisions, and realistic physical behaviors.

## Chapter Overview

In this chapter, you will learn:
- The fundamentals of Gazebo simulation environment
- How to create humanoid robot models in Gazebo
- Physics properties including gravity, friction, and collision detection
- How to configure realistic physical behaviors

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Create a simple humanoid robot model in Gazebo
- Apply physics properties and observe realistic movement
- Understand how robots interact with the environment based on physics properties
- Configure basic physics simulation parameters
