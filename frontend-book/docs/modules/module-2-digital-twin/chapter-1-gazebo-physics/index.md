# Chapter 1: Physics Simulation in Gazebo

## Overview

This chapter introduces you to physics-based simulation for humanoid robots using Gazebo. You'll learn how to create realistic physics environments that accurately model gravity, collisions, and environmental interactions that humanoid robots experience in the real world.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Set up Gazebo simulation environments with realistic physics properties
- Configure gravity, collision detection, and environmental parameters
- Model humanoid robot physics with accurate mass, inertia, and friction properties
- Validate physics simulation accuracy against real-world expectations

## Chapter Structure

This chapter is organized into the following sections:

1. [Physics Fundamentals](./physics-fundamentals.md) - Understanding the core physics concepts in Gazebo
2. [Collision Detection](./collision-detection.md) - Implementing and configuring collision detection systems
3. [Gravity and Environment Modeling](./gravity-environment-modeling.md) - Setting up realistic environmental physics

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, ensure you have:
- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- Basic understanding of physics concepts (gravity, mass, friction)
- Gazebo installed and configured in your ROS 2 environment

## Getting Started

Begin with the Physics Fundamentals section to understand the core concepts that govern physics simulation in Gazebo for humanoid robots.
