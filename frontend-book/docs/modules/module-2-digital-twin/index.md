# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics series, where we explore the concept of digital twins for humanoid robots using physics-based simulation and high-fidelity visualization. This module will guide you through creating comprehensive simulation environments that mirror the behavior of real-world humanoid robots.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand physics-based simulation and environment modeling in Gazebo
- Create high-fidelity visualizations and interactive environments in Unity
- Simulate various sensors (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs) for humanoid robots
- Integrate simulation environments with ROS 2 for real-time control
- Apply digital twin concepts to humanoid robot development

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three comprehensive chapters:

1. **Chapter 1: Physics Simulation in Gazebo** - Focus on physics-based simulation, gravity, collisions, and environment modeling
2. **Chapter 2: High-Fidelity Visualization in Unity** - Learn to create realistic visualization and interactive environments
3. **Chapter 3: Sensor Simulation** - Understand how to simulate LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs in both Gazebo and Unity

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- Basic understanding of humanoid robot kinematics
- Linux environment (Ubuntu 22.04 recommended) with ROS 2 Humble installed
- Development environment with Unity 2022.3 LTS

## Getting Started

Begin with Chapter 1 to understand the fundamentals of physics simulation in Gazebo, which will form the foundation for the more advanced visualization and sensor simulation concepts covered in subsequent chapters.
