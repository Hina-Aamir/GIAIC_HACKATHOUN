# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics series. This module introduces you to ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) as the middleware for humanoid robot control. You'll learn foundational concepts that are essential for later simulation and AI integration.

## Overview

ROS 2 serves as the "nervous system" of robotic applications, providing the communication infrastructure that connects sensors, actuators, AI agents, and control systems. In this module, you'll explore:

- The core concepts of ROS 2: nodes, topics, and services
- How to connect Python-based AI agents to ROS 2 using rclpy
- The representation of humanoid robots using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Explain the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 and its role in robot control
- Create Python nodes that communicate with ROS 2 using rclpy
- Understand and create URDF files for humanoid robot modeling
- Connect AI agents to ROS 2 for robot control

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Understanding of basic robotics concepts (helpful but not required)

## Module Structure

This module is divided into three chapters:

1. **ROS 2 Fundamentals**: Core concepts of nodes, topics, services, and message passing
2. **AI Agents with rclpy**: Connecting Python AI agents to ROS 2
3. **Humanoid Robot Modeling**: Understanding URDF structure and physical representation

Let's begin with understanding the fundamentals of ROS 2 in the next chapter.
