# LLM-Driven Planning from Instructions to ROS 2 Actions

This chapter explores how large language models can be used for cognitive planning in robotics, translating high-level language instructions into detailed ROS 2 action sequences that robots can execute.

## Chapter Overview

In this chapter, you will learn:
- The fundamentals of LLM integration with robotic planning systems
- Cognitive planning techniques using language models
- ROS 2 integration for executing LLM-generated action sequences
- Safety considerations when using LLMs for robot planning

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Integrate large language models with robotic planning systems
- Translate high-level language instructions into detailed ROS 2 action sequences
- Implement safety constraints and validation for LLM-generated plans
- Design cognitive planning systems that bridge language understanding and robotic action

## Integration with the VLA Pipeline

This chapter builds on the voice processing concepts from Chapter 1 and bridges language understanding with robotic execution.

- **Connection to Chapter 1**: This chapter uses voice commands processed in Chapter 1 as input for LLM-based planning.
- **Connection to Chapter 3**: The planning systems from this chapter are integrated with vision feedback in Chapter 3 for complete VLA systems.

To continue your learning journey, proceed to [Chapter 3: Integrated VLA Pipeline and Autonomous Humanoid Capstone Concept](../chapter-3-vla-integration/).
