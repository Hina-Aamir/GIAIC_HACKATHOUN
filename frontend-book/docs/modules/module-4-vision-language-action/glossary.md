# Glossary: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Module

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the Vision-Language-Action module.

## A

**Action Execution**: The process of performing robotic actions based on planned sequences, often guided by real-time visual feedback.

**Acoustic Modeling**: The process of mapping audio signals to phonetic units in speech recognition systems.

## C

**Cognitive Planning**: The use of AI systems, particularly LLMs, to interpret high-level goals and generate detailed action sequences for robots.

**Cross-modal Attention**: Attention mechanisms that focus on relevant elements across different modalities (e.g., visual elements based on language).

## E

**Embodied AI**: Artificial intelligence systems that interact with the physical world through robotic bodies.

## L

**Large Language Model (LLM)**: Advanced AI models trained on vast text corpora that can understand and generate human-like language.

**LLM Planning**: Using Large Language Models to interpret natural language commands and generate robotic action sequences.

## N

**Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: The ability of a system to interpret the meaning of human language commands.

## R

**ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)**: A flexible framework for writing robotic software that provides hardware abstraction, device drivers, and communication infrastructure.

**Real-time Processing**: Processing that occurs within strict time constraints to ensure responsive system behavior.

## S

**Speech Recognition**: The technology that converts spoken language into text that can be processed by computer systems.

**Safety Validation**: The process of verifying that robotic actions are safe before and during execution.

**Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)**: The computational problem of mapping an environment while tracking the robot's location within it.

## V

**Vision-Guided Action**: Robotic actions that are guided and adapted based on real-time visual feedback.

**Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: The integration of vision, language understanding, and robotic action in a unified system.

**Voice Processing**: The complete pipeline from audio input to command interpretation for robotic systems.

**Voice Activity Detection**: The process of detecting when speech is present in an audio signal.

## W

**Wake Word Detection**: The process of detecting specific activation words that signal a robot to begin listening for commands.

## Z

**Zero-Shot Learning**: The ability of a model to perform tasks it has not been specifically trained on, based on general knowledge.
