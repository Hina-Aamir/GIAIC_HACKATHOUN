# Language and Voice Interfaces for Humanoid Robots

This chapter introduces you to voice processing and language interfaces for humanoid robots, covering speech recognition and natural language processing techniques that enable robots to understand and respond to human commands.

## Chapter Overview

In this chapter, you will learn:
- The fundamentals of speech recognition for robotics applications
- Voice processing techniques for humanoid robots
- Natural language understanding for robot command interpretation
- Integration of voice interfaces with robotic systems

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Implement basic speech recognition systems for robot command processing
- Design voice interfaces that are intuitive for human-robot interaction
- Process natural language commands and extract semantic intent
- Integrate voice processing with robotic action systems

## Chapter Structure

1. [Speech Recognition for Robotics](./speech-recognition.md)
2. [Voice Processing and Command Interpretation](./voice-processing.md)

## Integration with the VLA Pipeline

This chapter serves as the foundation for understanding the complete Vision-Language-Action pipeline and how voice input is processed to drive robotic actions.

- **Connection to Chapter 2**: The voice commands processed in this chapter are interpreted by LLMs in Chapter 2 to generate action plans.
- **Connection to Chapter 3**: The voice processing from this chapter feeds into the complete integrated VLA system in Chapter 3.

To continue your learning journey, proceed to [Chapter 2: LLM-Driven Planning from Instructions to ROS 2 Actions](../chapter-2-llm-planning/).
