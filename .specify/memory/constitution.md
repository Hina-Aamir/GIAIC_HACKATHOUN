# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Authorship
Technical content MUST originate from formal specifications; All claims MUST be traceable to authoritative sources; Scientific accuracy is non-negotiable.

### II. Scientific Rigor
Content MUST be grounded in peer-reviewed research; Claims MUST be substantiated with citations; Speculation MUST be clearly labeled as such.

### III. Technical Accuracy
Code examples MUST be verified and functional; Implementation details MUST reflect current best practices; Corrections MUST be tracked and versioned.

### IV. Grounded RAG Responses
Chatbot responses MUST be strictly limited to source material; Hallucination is unacceptable; Response confidence MUST be quantified.

### V. Unified System Architecture
Book and chatbot MUST function as integrated system; Consistent user experience across components; Shared data models and interfaces required.

### VI. AI Tool Enforceability
Principles MUST be verifiable by automated tools; Compliance checks MUST be integrated into development workflow; Standards MUST be measurable and testable.

## Technical Standards

### Documentation Requirements
All content MUST follow Docusaurus standards; Cross-references MUST be validated; Search functionality MUST be maintained across all content.

### Deployment Standards
GitHub Pages deployment MUST be automated; Static content generation MUST be reproducible; Versioned releases MUST be tagged.

### RAG System Constraints
Vector database MUST be kept synchronized with content; Embedding quality MUST be monitored; Query response times MUST meet performance SLA.

## Development Workflow

### Content Creation Process
New content MUST begin with specification; Peer review REQUIRED before publication; Fact-checking MUST be automated where possible.

### Quality Assurance
Automated validation MUST check for hallucinations; Content accuracy MUST be verified against sources; Performance benchmarks MUST be maintained.

### Change Management
Modifications MUST preserve content integrity; Version control MUST track all changes; Rollback procedures MUST be documented.

## Governance

Specifications govern all content creation; Amendments require technical review board approval; Compliance audits MUST be conducted quarterly; All changes MUST be recorded in Prompt History Records.
